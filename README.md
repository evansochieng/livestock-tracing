# Livestock Tracing System

### Task Outline
The government and CIAT wish to develop a system that allows for the traceability of livestock, identifying which animals come from areas where forests are being deforested in order to plant pastures for the animals. You may assume that the following databases are already populated:
 
- Location of the animals (latitude, longitude, owner of the animals)
- Areas of deforestation (latitude, longitude, deforestation area or change of coverage)
 
With this information, the government wants to be able to identify the livestock that is in areas at risk of deforestation and carry out educational campaigns to prevent tree felling and implement other solutions. Your mission is to design an information system that helps identify which animals are in these deforested areas and which ones are not. There are no restrictions on the technologies to use, but the solution should be in a Docker image for rapid deployment.
 
The following deliverables are required:
- Define the scope of your solution.
- List of requirements properly classified.
- Software architecture of the proposed solution.
- Database model (can be SQL or NoSQL).
- Source code of the Information system that helps solve the problem.
